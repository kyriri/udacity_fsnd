Fyyur
-----

This is the first project on Udacity's Full-Stack Web Development Nanodegree.

Full instructions, as originally given, can be seen on the [assignment file](assignment.md). Here below is a compact version:


Highlight folders:
* `templates/pages` -- (provided complete to the student) 
* `templates/layouts` -- (provided complete to the student) 
* `templates/forms` -- (provided complete to the student) 
* Models in `app.py` -- (should be addapted by the student)
* `config.py` -- (should be addapted by the student)


##### Suggested flow of work

1. [ ] Connect to a PostgreSQL database in `config.py`. A project submission that uses a local database connection is fine.
2. [ ] Using SQLAlchemy, set up normalized models for the objects we support in our web app in the Models section of `app.py`. Check out the sample pages provided at /artists/1, /venues/1, and /shows/1 for examples of the data we want to model, using all of the learned best practices in database schema design. Implement missing model properties and relationships using database migrations via Flask-Migrate.
3. [ ] Implement form submissions for creating new Venues, Artists, and Shows. There should be proper constraints, powering the `/create` endpoints that serve the create form templates, to avoid duplicate or nonsensical form submissions. Submitting a form should create proper new records in the database.
4. [ ] Implement the controllers for listing venues, artists, and shows. Note the structure of the mock data used. We want to keep the structure of the mock data.
5. [ ] Implement search, powering the `/search` endpoints that serve the application's search functionalities.
6. [ ] Serve venue and artist detail pages, powering the `<venue|artist>/<id>` endpoints that power the detail pages.


##### Constraints

- [ ] There should be no use of mock data throughout the app. The data structure of the mock data per controller should be kept unmodified when satisfied by real data.
- The application should behave just as before with mock data, but now uses real data from a real backend server, with real search functionality. For example:
  [ ] when a user submits a new artist record, the user should be able to see it populate in /artists, as well as search for the artist by name and have the search return results.
  [ ] I should be able to go to the URL `/artist/<artist-id>` to visit a particular artistâ€™s page using a unique ID per artist, and see real data about that particular artist.
  [ ] Venues should continue to be displayed in groups by city and state.
  [ ] Search should be allowed to be partial string matching and case-insensitive.
  [ ] Past shows versus Upcoming shows should be distinguished in Venue and Artist pages.
  [ ] A user should be able to click on the venue for an upcoming show in the Artist's page, and on that Venue's page, see the same show in the Venue Page's upcoming shows section.
- As a fellow developer on this application, I should be able to run `flask db migrate`, and have my local database (once set up and created) be populated with the right tables to run this application and have it interact with my local postgres server, serving the application's needs completely with real data I can seed my local database with.
  [ ] The models should be completed (see TODOs in the `Models` section of `app.py`) and model the objects used throughout Fyyur.
  [ ] Define the models in a different file to follow [Separation of Concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns) design principles. You can refactor the models to a new file, such as `models.py`.
  [ ] The relationship between the models should be accurately configured, and referential integrity amongst the models should be preserved.
  [ ] `flask db migrate` should work, and populate my local postgres database with properly configured tables for this application's objects, including proper columns, column data types, constraints, defaults, and relationships that completely satisfy the needs of this application. The proper type of relationship between venues, artists, and shows should be configured.

##### Optional features

- [ ] Implement artist availability. An artist can list available times that they can be booked. Restrict venues from being able to create shows with artists during a show time that is outside of their availability.
- [ ] Show Recent Listed Artists and Recently Listed Venues on the homepage, returning results for Artists and Venues sorting by newly created. Limit to the 10 most recently listed items.
- [ ] Implement Search Artists by City and State, and Search Venues by City and State. Searching by "San Francisco, CA" should return all artists or venues in San Francisco, CA.
